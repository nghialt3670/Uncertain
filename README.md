# Uncertain

**Uncertain** is a social deduction game inspired by **Undercover**, where a small group of players (aliens) receive a different word than the rest (humans). The game is turn-based: each player takes turns describing their word without revealing it directly, and at the end of each round, players vote to eliminate the suspected aliens. The goal for humans is to identify and eliminate all aliens, while aliens aim to survive undetected.

This project was created as a learning experience with Unity, focusing on UI/UX design, gameplay mechanics, and multi-language support.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Players are secretly assigned roles: **Humans** or **Aliens**
- All players receive a word, but aliens receive a subtly different one
- Each player describes their word in a turn-based manner
- After discussion, everyone votes to eliminate one player
- Repeat until either all aliens are eliminated (Humans win), or aliens survive until the end (Aliens win)
